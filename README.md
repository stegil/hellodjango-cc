## Django Project vs Apps
- A Django project is a folder containing all the code
(Python, templates, etc.) needed to run a website.
- A Django app is a folder within a Django project.
- Django apps are isolated components that do one
specific thing in a Django project.
- Combining Django apps is one of the primary
things we do when we build a Django project


## Understanding Views & TemplateView Class:
- Views are how a Django project communicates with
the user. They send out web pages, JSON, spreadsheets, PDFs, and so much more.
- Templates are often used by views to render HTML
for web pages.
- A TemplateView renders a Django template and sends
it to a browser.


## How Is a View Method Different From Context Data?
Itâ€™s the difference between evaluating a variable and evaluating a function call.
- *Context data* Variables used in the template.
- *View methods* Functions that we can call from the template.

**Typically projects rely on Context Data**, but there are advanced use cases for using view methods instead.
